                A continent is one of several large landmasses. Generally identified by convention rather than any
                strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in area
                to smallest, these seven regions are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe,
                and Australia. Variations with fewer continents may merge some of these, for example some systems
                include Eurasia or America as single continents.<br><br>

                Geologically, the continents correspond to areas of continental crust that are found on the continental
                plates, but include continental fragments such as Madagascar that are not commonly referred to as
                continents while others are largely covered with water, such as Zealandia. Continental crust is only
                known to exist on Earth.<br><br>

                Oceanic islands are frequently grouped with a neighbouring continent to divide all the world's land into
                regions. Under this scheme, most of the island countries and territories in the Pacific Ocean are
                grouped together with the continent of Australia to form a region called Oceania.<br><br>

                    alt="">
                Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located
                primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with
                the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa. Asia
                covers an area of 44,579,000 square kilometres (17,212,000 sq mi), about 30% of Earth's total land area
                and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of
                the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.5 billion people (as of
                June 2019) constitute roughly 60% of the world's population.<br><br>

                In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean,
                and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural
                construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat
                arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into
                two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a
                spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the
                east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural
                Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black Seas,
                separating it from Europe.<br><br>

                China and India alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 CE. China was a
                major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and
                prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce,
                exploration and colonialism. The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America
                by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination. The Silk Road
                became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a
                major sea route. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust
                population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen. Asia was
                the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism,
                Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other
                religions.<br><br>

                Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually
                have more to do with human geography than physical geography.[citation needed] Asia varies greatly
                across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics,
                historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the
                equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the continental
                centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia.<br><br>

                Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. At
                about 30.3 million km2 (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's
                total surface area and 20% of its land area. With 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts
                for about 16% of the world's human population. Africa's population is the youngest amongst all the
                continents;[8][9] the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4.[10] Despite a
                wide range of Natural resources, Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita, in part due to
                geographic impediments, legacies of European colonization in Africa and the Cold
                War, predatory/neo-colonialistic activities by Western nations and China, and
                undemocratic rule and deleterious policies. Despite this low concentration of wealth, recent
                economic expansion and the large and young population make Africa an important economic market in the
                broader global context.<br><br>

                The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea
                to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent
                includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states
                (countries), eight territories and two de facto independent states with limited or no recognition.
                Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. African nations
                cooperate through the establishment of the African Union, which is headquartered in Addis Ababa.<br><br>

                Africa straddles the equator and the prime meridian making it the only continent in the world to be
                situated in all four cardinal hemispheres. It is the only continent to stretch from the northern
                temperate to southern temperate zones. The majority of the continent and its countries are in the
                Northern Hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Most
                of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a large part of Western Sahara, Algeria, Libya and
                Egypt, the northern tip of Mauritania, the entire territories of Morocco, Ceuta, Melilla and Tunisia
                which in turn are located above the tropic of Cancer, in the northern temperate zone. In the other
                extreme of the continent, southern Namibia, southern Botswana, great parts of South Africa, the entire
                territories of Lesoto and Eswatini and the southern tips of Mozambique and Madagascar are located below
                the tropic of Capricorn, in the southern temperate zone.<br><br>

                North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western
                Hemisphere. It can also be described as the northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the
                north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the southeast by South America and the
                Caribbean Sea, and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean. Because it is on the North American
                Tectonic Plate, Greenland is included as part of North America geographically.<br><br>

                North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5%
                of the Earth's land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third-largest
                continent by area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after Asia, Africa, and
                Europe. In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states, or
                about 7.5% of the world's population.<br><br>

                North America was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period, via crossing
                the Bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called Paleo-Indian period is
                taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the Archaic or Meso-Indian period).
                The classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The pre-Columbian era ended in 1492, with the
                beginning of the transatlantic migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early
                modern period. However, the first recorded European references to North America (other than Greenland)
                are around 1000 AD in Norse sagas in which it is referred to as Vinland. Present-day cultural and ethnic
                patterns reflect interactions between European colonists, indigenous peoples, African slaves, immigrants
                from Europe, Asia, and South Asia, and the descendants of these groups.<br><br>

                Owing to Europe's colonization of the Americas, most North Americans speak European languages such as
                English, Spanish or French, and their cultures commonly reflect Western traditions. However, in parts of
                Canada, the United States, Mexico, and Central America, there are indigenous populations continuing
                their cultural traditions and speaking their own languages.<br><br>

                South America is a continent entirely in the Western Hemisphere[note 6] and mostly in the Southern
                Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be described as the
                southern subcontinent of the Americas. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like
                Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in recent decades due to changing geopolitical
                dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).<br><br>

                South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic
                Ocean, North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the northwest. The continent generally includes twelve
                sovereign states: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru,
                Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela; two dependent territories: the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and
                the South Sandwich Islands; and one internal territory: French Guiana. In addition, the
                ABC islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ascension Island (dependency of Saint Helena, Ascension
                and Tristan da Cunha, a British Overseas Territory), Bouvet Island (dependency of Norway), Panama, and
                Trinidad and Tobago may also be considered parts of South America.<br><br>

                South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its population as of 2018
                has been estimated at more than 423 million. South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia,
                Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America).
                Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's
                population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also
                generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the continent's first regional power.<br><br>

                Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the
                far south are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the Andes
                mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers
                such as the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraná flow. Most of the continent lies in the tropics, except for a
                large part of the Southern Cone located in the middle latitudes.<br><br>

                Antarctica (/ænˈtɑːrtɪkə/ or /ænˈtɑːrktɪkə/ (About this soundlisten))[note 1] is Earth's southernmost
                continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern
                Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At
                14,200,000 square kilometres (5,500,000 square miles), it is the fifth-largest continent and nearly
                twice the size of Australia. It is by far the least populated continent, with around 5,000 people in the
                summer and around 1,000 in the winter. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km
                (1.2 mi; 6,200 ft) in thickness, which extends to all but the McMurdo Dry Valleys and the
                northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula.<br><br>

                Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average
                elevation of all the continents. Most of Antarctica is a polar desert, with annual precipitation of
                200 mm (7.9 in) along the coast and far less inland; yet 80% of the world freshwater reserves are stored
                there, enough to raise global sea levels by about 60 metres (200 ft) if all of it were to melt.
                The temperature in Antarctica has dropped to −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F) (or even −94.7 °C (−135.8 °F) as
                measured from space), though the average for the third quarter (the coldest part of the year) is −63
                °C (−81 °F). Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants,
                protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation,
                where it occurs, is tundra.<br><br>

                Antarctica was the last region on Earth to be discovered, likely unseen until 1820 when the Russian
                expedition of Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev on Vostok and Mirny sighted the
                Fimbul ice shelf. The continent remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of
                its harsh environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In January 1840, land at
                Antarctica was discovered for the first time, almost simultaneously, by the United States Exploring
                Expedition, under Lieut; Charles Wilkes; and a separate French expedition under Jules Dumont d'Urville.
                The latter made a temporary landing. The Wilkes expedition—though it did not make a landing—remained
                long enough in the region to survey and map some 800 miles of the continent. The first confirmed landing
                was by a team of Norwegians in 1895.<br><br>

                Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere.
                It comprises the westernmost peninsulas of the continental landmass of Eurasia, and is bordered by
                the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and
                Asia to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural
                Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterways of
                the Turkish Straits. Although much of this border is over land, Europe is generally accorded the
                status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of its history and
                traditions.<br><br>

                Europe covers about 10,180,000 km2 (3,930,000 sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area),
                making it the second smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is
                divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning
                39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 746
                million (about 10% of the world population) in 2018. The European climate is largely affected by
                warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at latitudes along
                which the climate in Asia and North America is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are
                more noticeable than close to the coast.<br><br>

                European culture is the root of Western civilization, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece
                and ancient Rome. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and the subsequent Migration
                Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Renaissance
                humanism, exploration, art and science led to the modern era. Since the Age of Discovery, started by
                Portugal and Spain, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th
                centuries, European powers colonized at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania,
                and the majority of Asia.<br><br>

                Oceania is a
                geographic region that includes Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. Spanning the
                Eastern and Western Hemispheres, Oceania has a land area of 8,525,989 square kilometres (3,291,903 sq
                mi) and a population of over 41 million. When compared with the continents, the region of Oceania is the
                smallest in land area and the second smallest in population after Antarctica.<br><br>

                Oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial
                markets of Australia, New Caledonia and New Zealand, which rank high in quality of life and human
                development index, to the much less developed economies such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesian New
                Guinea, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Tuvalu, while also including medium-sized economies of Pacific islands
                such as Palau, Fiji and Tonga. The largest and most populous country in Oceania is Australia, and the
                largest city is Sydney.<br><br>

                The first settlers of Australia, New Guinea, and the large islands just to the east arrived more than
                60,000 years ago. Oceania was first explored by Europeans from the 16th century onward. Portuguese
                navigators, between 1512 and 1526, reached the Tanimbar Islands, some of the Caroline Islands and west
                Papua New Guinea. On his first voyage in the 18th century, James Cook, who later arrived at the highly
                developed Hawaiian Islands, went to Tahiti and followed the east coast of Australia for the first
                time. The Pacific front saw major action during the Second World War, mainly between Allied powers
                the United States and Australia, and Axis power Japan.<br><br>
